# Project: Lavendar
Lavendar is the project name for a (currently unnamed) 3D Multiplayer FPS tower-defense game written mostly in C# utilizing the Godot game engine.

The project has been worked on by me(BeaconBytes) alone over the past 2-3 years. It was largely supposed to be my first "big-scale" video game project, and I believe it has definetly acheived that!

Initially when the project was first started I wanted to make my own networking solution. This eventually grew into the (now archived) KableNetLib that is also here on my GitHub page.
Although I learned a lot from making KableNetLib, I ultimately decided to instead switch over to a already existing solution: LiteNetLib. This was done halfway through development and, although quite a tedious change,
I think it was the better choice in the end.

Currently I'm unsure if I will continue to develop this project going forward. It has achieved much of its original goal, and I believe any futher work on it should be considered heavy scope-creep.

A couple notable things already added in the project:
 - Full Mutiplayer
 - Client prediction and server reconsilation
 - Fully Authoritative Server
 - Basic NPC Entities
 - Pathfinding
 - Menu System

Some notable mechanics that were implemented mostly or fully at one point, but scrapped or abandoned for various reasons:
 - Precedural Terrain Generation
 - Voxel Destructable Terrain
 - Lobby System
 - Inventory System
 - Structure Placement & Interactions
 - Many movement related mechanics
