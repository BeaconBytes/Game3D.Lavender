The project, currently nicknamed ``Project Coconut``, is a video game about sandbox'd survival revolving around instanced play.

### Definitions
 - #### Sandbox Survival
	Sandbox Survival games let spawn players in a world where they must survive to reach the end goals of the game
 - #### Instanced Play
	 Instanced play, in this context, means the players will have very little if any risk of actual death from combat. Instead, upon entering combat the players and their pets are taken into another dimension for a fight in a arena. The victor will be rewarded heavily, and the losing party will receive heavy penalties and possibly forfeit their inventory/gear and/or a currently unspecified way of forfeiting pets to the victor.
